# Quick_Bite-Sales-Report

An analysis of Pizza sales to determine information such as 
  Total Revenue
  Average Order
  Average Pizza per Order
  Total Pizza Sold
  Daily and Monthly order trends for total pizza sold
  Percentage of sales by Pizza Category 
  Percentage of sales by Pizza size

  Top 5 Pizza by Total Revenue

Excel, SQL, PowerBI, and DAX expressions were used for this analysis

I mostly use SQL to check my DAX codes and validate they are correct

DAX was used to create the DATE table, New column, such as Order day and Measures

The data for this project is available in this repository.

PSA: Quick_Bite is a fictional name, and the data mock-up
